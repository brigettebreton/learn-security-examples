Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The vulnerability is that the code allows the possibility of malicious users injecting 
NoSQL code and gathering information from the response. This vulnerability exists because
the insecure code does not sanitize the username input provided by the get request. The 
code sends a response as to whether or not the username was found by the server, but fails 
to error out if the get request does.

In contrast, the secure code sanitizes the input, wraps the request response in a try-catch 
block, and verifies that the username provided is a string, preventing pattern matching 
opportunities.

Which CIA property does information disclosure violate?

Information Disclosure violates the Confidentiality property.

What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

Information can also be concealed within request URLs by managing the URL format 
on the backend. This action would hinder users from exploiting the format of 
request URLs.
