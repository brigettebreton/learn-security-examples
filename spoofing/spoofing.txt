Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The issue with the provided code lies in its failure to adequately verify the user's 
identity before allowing access to confidential data. Within the /sensitive route, the 
code verifies if req.session.user matches 'Admin' and, if true, assigns 
req.session.sensitive as 'supersecret' and sends a success message. However, there's a 
lack of a robust authentication mechanism to verify that the user is genuinely the admin.

This flaw could be exploited by an attacker who manipulates req.session.user to 'Admin' 
without authenticating as the admin. Consequently, unauthorized users could access 
sensitive data.
