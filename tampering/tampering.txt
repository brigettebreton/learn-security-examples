The issue arises due to the inadequate 
protection and validation of the session ID. 
In this code snippet, the session secret key, 
used for signing the session ID, is passed as 
a command-line argument (process.argv[2]). 
However, this method is not secure for 
handling the secret key. It's preferable to 
securely store the secret key, such as in an 
environment variable or a configuration file 
that isn't publicly accessible.

This vulnerability violates the integrity 
aspect of the CIA triad, which encompasses 
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. 
Integrity ensures that data remains unchanged 
and intact. In this scenario, the session data 
can be tampered with, compromising its integrity. 
An attacker could manipulate the session ID, 
gaining unauthorized access and potentially 
altering or tampering with the session data.
