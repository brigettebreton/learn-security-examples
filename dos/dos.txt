- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The vulnerable code utilizes an ID from the get request sent via userinfo. However, it 
lacks input sanitization and error handling, causing it to crash when provided with a 
non-properly formatted ID or a regular expression. This vulnerability arises due to the 
lack of checks on the input data.

In contrast, the secure version first verifies if an actual user can be found using the 
provided ID in the query. If the ID is invalid or improperly formatted, the secure code 
gracefully handles the error by reporting that a bad ID was provided, thus preventing 
the application from crashing.


- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Additional security measures that could be implemented include sanitizing input data, 
avoiding direct use of sensitive identifiers like IDs, introducing rate limiting to 
prevent flooding attacks, and using middleware for request management to avoid 
overwhelming the server with excessive requests from a single user or IP address.
