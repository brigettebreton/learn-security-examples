- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing 
repudiation than the insecure version.

The insecure code allows users to impersonate others by manually entering any user ID 
and sending messages without accountability. This lack of logging and verification opens 
the door for repudiation, where users can deny their actions or lie about the messages 
they sent. Conversely, the secure version logs every message along with method type, URL, 
and sender's IP address, providing admins with a clear audit trail to prevent repudiation.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

To prevent attacks, we can incorporate enhanced security by using libraries for automated 
request logging, implement automated flagging and manual checks for suspicious activities 
in logs, and store log files securely in a database to prevent tampering and ensure integrity 
for auditing.
