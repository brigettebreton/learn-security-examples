- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The insecure code allows any user to change the role of another user by manipulating the 
input, leading to potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities. Conversely, the secure 
version stores user IDs in sessions and verifies if the user has admin privileges before 
allowing role edits, thus preventing unauthorized role changes and privilege manipulation.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Additional security measures can include implementing 2FA for user identity verification 
and incorporating role-based privilege checks in the code to prevent unauthorized role 
changes and privilege escalation. These steps help ensure that only authorized users with 
appropriate credentials can access privileged actions.
